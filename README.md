# ObeseOSA
This study utilized a systems biology and machine learning approach to uncover molecular mechanisms and diagnostic biomarkers for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in obese individuals, focusing on adipose tissue transcriptomes.
The study utilized machine learning, specifically random forest (RF), for feature selection to identify potential diagnostic gene signatures for OSA in obese individuals. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR) models were then employed for classification and validation of these signatures. Notably, SVM demonstrated robust performance on the GSE38792 dataset, achieving an F1-score of 0.90 and an AUC of 0.85, indicating high sensitivity and specificity in identifying OSA. This machine learning approach pinpointed 44 genes as potential diagnostic markers, with YWHAE, EIF5AL1///EIF5A, and LOC100128233 consistently identified across multiple datasets, providing a systems-level framework with strong translational potential for precision diagnostics.
